# Summer-of-Bitcoin

Welcome to my Summer of Bitcoin assignment repository! This project documents my work and progress through the assigned tasks over four weeks. Each week focuses on a different aspect of Bitcoin development, from interacting with a Bitcoin node to exploring descriptor wallets. This README provides an overview of the tasks and the work completed.
