# Summer-of-Bitcoin

Welcome to my Summer of Bitcoin assignment repository! This project documents my work and progress through the assigned tasks over four weeks. Each week focuses on a different aspect of Bitcoin development, from interacting with a Bitcoin node to exploring descriptor wallets. This README provides an overview of the tasks and the work completed.

## Project Overview
This repository contains code, documentation, and resources related to the following weekly assignments:
- **Week 1**: Interacting with a Bitcoin Node
- **Week 2**: Building a P2SH-P2WSH Multisig Transaction
- **Week 3**: Mining a Block
- **Week 4**: Descriptor Wallets

The goal of this project is to deepen my understanding of Bitcoin's technical underpinnings and demonstrate practical skills in blockchain development.

## Weekly Breakdown

### Week 1: Interacting with a Bitcoin Node
- **Objective**: Learn how to connect to and interact with a Bitcoin node using RPC calls or other methods.
- **Tasks**:
  - Set up a Bitcoin node (e.g., Bitcoin Core).
  - Query blockchain data (e.g., block height, transactions).
  - Test basic commands like `getblockchaininfo` or `getrawtransaction`.
- **Files**: [week1/](week1/)
- **Notes**: Successfully connected to a regtest node and retrieved block data.
